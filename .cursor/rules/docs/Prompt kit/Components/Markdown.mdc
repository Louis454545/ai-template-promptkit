Performance Optimization
------------------------

The Markdown component employs advanced memoization techniques to optimize rendering performance, especially in streaming AI response scenarios. This approach is crucial when rendering chat interfaces where new tokens are continuously streamed.

### How Memoization Works

Our implementation:

1.  Splits Markdown content into discrete semantic blocks using the `marked` library
2.  Memoizes each block individually with React's `memo`
3.  Only re-renders blocks that have actually changed when new content arrives
4.  Preserves already rendered blocks to prevent unnecessary re-parsing and re-rendering

This pattern significantly improves performance in chat applications by preventing the entire message history from re-rendering with each new token, which becomes increasingly important as conversations grow longer.

For AI chat interfaces using streaming responses, always provide a unique `id` prop (typically the message ID) to ensure proper block caching:

```
<Markdown id={message.id}>{message.content}</Markdown>
```


This memoization implementation is based on the [Vercel AI SDK Cookbook](https://sdk.vercel.ai/cookbook/next/markdown-chatbot-with-memoization) with enhancements for better React integration.

Customizing Components
----------------------

You can customize how different Markdown elements are rendered by providing a `components` prop. This is an object where keys are HTML element names and values are React components.

```
const customComponents = {
  h1: ({ children }) => <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-500">{children}</h1>,
  a: ({ href, children }) => <a href={href} className="text-purple-500 underline">{children}</a>,
  // ... other components
}

<Markdown components={customComponents}>{markdownContent}</Markdown>

```


Supported Markdown Features
---------------------------

The Markdown component uses [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) with [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) to support GitHub Flavored Markdown, which includes:

*   Tables
*   Strikethrough
*   Tasklists
*   Literal URLs
*   Footnotes

Additionally, the component includes built-in code block highlighting through the `CodeBlock` component.

Styling with Tailwind Typography
--------------------------------

For the best typography styling experience, we recommend using the [@tailwindcss/typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) plugin. This plugin provides a set of `prose` classes that add beautiful typographic defaults to your markdown content.

```
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```


When using the Markdown component with Tailwind Typography, you can apply the `prose` class:

```
<Markdown className="prose dark:prose-invert">{markdownContent}</Markdown>
```


### Handling Code Blocks

As you've seen in our examples, code blocks within prose content can sometimes cause styling conflicts. The Tailwind Typography plugin provides a `not-prose` class to exclude elements from prose styling:

```
<article className="prose">
  <h1>My Content</h1>
  <p>Regular content with prose styling...</p>

  <div className="not-prose">
    <!-- Code blocks or other elements that shouldn't inherit prose styles -->
  </div>

</article>

```
