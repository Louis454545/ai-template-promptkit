Scroll Button
=============

A floating button component that appears when users scroll up in a container, allowing them to quickly return to the bottom of the content with a single click.

Examples
--------

### Basic Scroll Button

A simple implementation of the scroll button that appears when scrolling up and disappears when at the bottom of the container.



### Custom Scroll Button

Customize the appearance and behavior of the scroll button with different variants, sizes, and threshold values.


### With Chat Container

The ScrollButton works perfectly with ChatContainer for chat interfaces, providing an easy way for users to navigate long conversations.



```
.container {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
gap: 1rem;
}
```

This creates a grid where:

*   Columns automatically fit as many as possible
*   Each column is at least 250px wide
*   Columns expand to fill available space
*   There's a 1rem gap between items

Would you like me to explain more about how this works?
